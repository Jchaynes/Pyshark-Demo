# PyShark
The PyShark library is a Python wrapper for the popular packet analysis tool called Wireshark. It allows you to capture, dissect, and analyze network packets programmatically using Python. Here's a brief introduction and explanation of PyShark:

1. Packet Analysis:
   * PyShark provides a high-level interface to capture, analyze, and process network packets.
   * It allows you to read packet capture files (PCAP or PCAPNG format) or capture live packets from network interfaces.
   * PyShark supports various network protocols and provides access to packet headers, fields, and data.

2. Features and Functionality:
   * PyShark provides several functionalities for packet analysis, including:
     * Packet filtering: You can define filters to capture specific packets based on protocol, source/destination IP addresses, ports, etc.
     * Packet dissection: PyShark allows you to dissect packets and access individual protocol layers, fields, and their values.
     * Statistics and metrics: You can extract statistical information from captured packets, such as packet counts, bandwidth usage, and protocol distribution.
     * Stream reassembly: PyShark can reassemble fragmented packets into complete streams for further analysis.
     * Decryption: It supports decrypting encrypted network traffic using decryption keys or certificates.

3. Usage Example:
   * Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use PyShark to capture and analyze network packets:
     ```python
     import pyshark

     # Capture packets on a network interface
     capture = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='eth0')

     # Set a display filter to capture specific packets
     capture.set_display_filter('http')

     # Start capturing packets
     capture.sniff(timeout=10)

     # Process captured packets
     for packet in capture:
         # Access packet information
         print(packet.tcp.srcport, packet.http.request_uri)

     # Close the capture
     capture.close()
     ```

4. Benefits:
   * PyShark provides a Pythonic interface for packet analysis, allowing you to leverage Python's flexibility and functionality for network traffic analysis.
   * It enables automation and scripting of packet analysis tasks, making it suitable for network monitoring, security analysis, and troubleshooting.
   * PyShark integrates well with other Python libraries and tools, enabling seamless integration into larger projects or workflows.

PyShark simplifies the process of capturing and analyzing network packets, making it a valuable tool for network engineers, security analysts, and developers working with network-related applications. It combines the power of Wireshark with the ease of Python programming, providing a convenient way to work with network packet data.
